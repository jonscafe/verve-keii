This is a walkthrough of a memory forensics challenge called "sandboxed debugging," that i designed for the Cyber Jawara National 2024 Final Round. The goal is to analyze a memory dump from a Windows Sandbox, identify a malicious process, uncover its encryption method, and decrypt its network traffic to retrieve a flag. Let’s dive into the solution!

### Scenario
Prof. Darmodar and his student Jono were researching on a Windows instance when Prof. Darmodar’s wife, Chizuru, spilled coffee on the PC, frying it. Fortunately, a memory dump was captured before the crash. Your task is to analyze this dump and extract critical information.

#### Challenge Objectives
- Identify the Malicious Process: Find the rogue process hiding in the memory dump.
- Determine Encryption Method: Figure out how the malware encrypts its network traffic.
- Decrypt the Traffic: Use the encryption details to decode the traffic and extract the flag.

`Note: Traditional tools like Volatility won’t work due to symbol mismatches, so we’ll rely on MemprocFS, a hex editor, and WinDbg.`

#### Tools Required
- MemProcFS: Mounts the memory dump as a file system for analysis. (https://github.com/ufrisk/MemProcFS)
- Hex Editor: Allows manual inspection of raw memory data.
- WinDbg: Analyzes minidumps extracted from the memory.
Basic knowledge of memory forensics and Windows internals is also helpful.

### Step-by-Step Solution

#### Step 1: Mount the Memory Dump
Use MemprocFS to mount the memory dump file (e.g., named mem) and explore it as a virtual file system.
Command:
`memprocfs -device mem -forensic 4`

For this guide, assume it’s mounted to the M: drive.
#### Step 2: Review Recent Processes
Navigate to `M:\timeline\timeline_process.txt` to view a timeline of processes that were running. Look for anything unusual in the context of a Windows Sandbox environment.
#### Step 3: Identify the Malicious Process
In the timeline, you’ll notice `splwow32.exe` launched from `C:\Windows` by a user, not the system. While splwow32.exe is a legitimate process, user-initiated execution in a sandbox is suspicious and suggests malware (not by `SYSTEM` or `NETWORK`). The original malware file is corrupted and not in RAM, so we’ll need to dig deeper.
#### Step 4: Analyze Minidumps
Explore minidumps in `M:\name` to uncover clues about the malware’s behavior.

##### Analyzing the splwow32.exe Minidump
Open the minidump for `splwow32.exe-3056` in WinDbg (or you can analyze its blob/raw data).
Check the loaded modules—evidence reveals it’s Python-based malware disguised as a legitimate process.
Use WinDbg or a hex editor to extract details about its encryption mechanism.

##### Analyzing the `wireshark.exe` Minidump
Open the `wireshark.exe` minidump in WinDbg (or you can analyze its blob/raw data).
Extract the captured network traffic data.
Apply the encryption details from the `splwow32.exe` analysis to decrypt the traffic and reveal the flag.

#### Step 5: Alternative Analysis Techniques
If needed, try these additional methods:
- mftparser: Examine file system metadata for more context.
- Hex Editor: Search raw memory for encryption patterns or strings.

### Conclusion
By mounting the dump with MemprocFS, identifying `splwow32.exe` as the malicious process, and analyzing minidumps with WinDbg, you can decrypt the network traffic and retrieve the flag. This challenge tests your ability to adapt and use creative forensic techniques!
